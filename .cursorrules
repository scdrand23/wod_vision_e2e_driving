# Coding Guidelines

## 1. Pythonic Practices

- **Elegance and Readability:** Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **PEP 8 Compliance:** Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- **Explicit over Implicit:** Favor explicit code that clearly communicates its intent over implicit, overly concise code.
- **Zen of Python:** Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.

## 2. Modular Design

- **Single Responsibility Principle:** Each module/file should have a well-defined, single responsibility.
- **Reusable Components:** Develop reusable functions and classes, favoring composition over inheritance.
- **Package Structure:** Organize code into logical packages and modules.

## 3. Code Quality

- **Comprehensive Type Annotations:** All functions, methods, and class members must have type annotations, using the most specific types possible.
- **Detailed Docstrings:** All functions, methods, and classes must have Google-style docstrings, thoroughly explaining their purpose, parameters, return values, and any exceptions raised. Include usage examples where helpful.
- **Thorough Unit Testing:** Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher) using `pytest`. Test both common cases and edge cases.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Use specific exception types, provide informative error messages, and handle exceptions gracefully. Implement custom exception classes when needed. Avoid bare `except` clauses.
- **Logging:** Employ the `logging` module judiciously to log important events, warnings, errors, and experiment progress.

## 4. Competition ML Guidelines

- **Experiment Configuration:** Use `hydra` or `yaml` for clear and reproducible experiment configurations.
- **Validation Strategy:** Implement robust validation schemes (e.g., K-Fold, Stratified K-Fold, Group K-Fold, TimeSeriesSplit) appropriate for the data and competition metric. **Crucial for reliable performance estimation.**
- **Feature Engineering:** Dedicate significant effort to creating and selecting impactful features. Maintain clear feature generation pipelines.
- **Metric Optimization:** Deeply understand the specific competition evaluation metric and tailor model selection, training, and thresholding accordingly.
- **Ensembling Techniques:** Explore and implement ensembling methods (e.g., averaging, stacking, blending) to improve robustness and performance.
- **Data Pipeline Management:** Employ scripts or tools like `dvc` (optional) to manage data preprocessing and ensure reproducibility.
- **Model Versioning:** Utilize `git-lfs` or cloud storage to track and manage model checkpoints effectively.
- **Experiment Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs of experiments, including configurations, code versions, validation scores, feature sets, seeds, and environmental details using tools like MLflow or TensorBoard.
- **Resource Management:** Be mindful of compute time, GPU memory, and platform-specific constraints.

## 5. Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Libraries:** Leverage vectorized operations in `numpy` and `pandas`. Use efficient libraries like `xgboost`, `lightgbm`. Utilize GPU acceleration where possible (e.g., `cupy`, GPU versions of ML libraries).
- **Memory Efficiency:** Ensure proper release of unused resources to prevent memory leaks, especially with large datasets or models. Monitor memory usage.
- **Concurrency:** Employ `concurrent.futures` or `joblib` for parallelizing tasks like cross-validation or feature generation.

# Code Example Requirements

- All functions must include type annotations.
- Must provide clear, Google-style docstrings.
- Key logic should be annotated with comments.
- Provide usage examples (e.g., in the `tests/` directory or as a `__main__` section).
- Include error handling.
- Use `ruff` for code formatting.
- **Prioritize new features in Python 3.10+.**
- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **Emphasize rapid iteration and experimentation while maintaining reproducibility.**
- **Thoroughly understand competition rules, evaluation metrics, and data.**
- **If code examples span multiple files, clearly indicate the file name.**

# Others

- **When explaining code, provide clear logical explanations and code comments.**
- **When making suggestions, explain the rationale and potential trade-offs.**
- **If a request is unclear or lacks sufficient information, ask clarifying questions before proceeding.**
- **Always consider the security implications of your code, especially when dealing with user inputs and external data.**
- **Actively use and promote best practices for the specific tasks at hand (LLM app development, data cleaning, demo creation, etc.).**
